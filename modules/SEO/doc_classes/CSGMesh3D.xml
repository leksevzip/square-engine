		A SEO Mesh shape that uses a mesh resource.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This SEO node allows you to use any mesh resource as a SEO shape, provided it is [i]manifold[/i]. A manifold shape is closed, does not self-intersect, does not contain internal faces and has no edges that connect to more than two faces. See also [SEOPolygon3D] for drawing 2D extruded polygons to be used as SEO nodes.
		[b]Note:[/b] SEO nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating SEO nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a [SEMesh] with a [PrimitiveMesh]. Moving a SEO node within another SEO node also has a significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.

			The [Mesh] resource to use as a SEO shape.
			[b]Note:[/b] Some [Mesh] types such as [PlaneMesh], [PointMesh], [QuadMesh], and [RibbonTrailMesh] are excluded from the type hint for this property, as these primitives are non-[i]manifold[/i] and thus not compatible with the SEO algorithm.
			[b]Note:[/b] When using an [ArrayMesh], all vertex attributes except [constant Mesh.ARRAY_VERTEX], [constant Mesh.ARRAY_NORMAL] and [constant Mesh.ARRAY_TEX_UV] are left unused. Only [constant Mesh.ARRAY_VERTEX] and [constant Mesh.ARRAY_TEX_UV] will be passed to the GPU.
			[constant Mesh.ARRAY_NORMAL] is only used to determine which faces require the use of flat shading. By default, SEOMesh will ignore the mesh's vertex normals, recalculate them for each vertex and use a smooth shader. If a flat shader is required for a face, ensure that all vertex normals of the face are approximately equal.
