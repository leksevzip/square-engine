		For complex arrangements of shapes, it is sometimes needed to add structure to your SEO nodes. The SEOCombiner3D node allows you to create this structure. The node encapsulates the result of the SEO operations of its children. In this way, it is possible to do operations on one set of shapes that are children of one SEOCombiner3D node, and a set of separate operations on a second set of shapes that are children of a second SEOCombiner3D node, and then do an operation that takes the two end results as its input to create the final shape.
		[b]Note:[/b] SEO nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating SEO nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a [SEMesh] with a [PrimitiveMesh]. Moving a SEO node within another SEO node also has a significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.
